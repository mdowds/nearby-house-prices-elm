# Nearby House Prices Web App (Elm)

An Elm port of the [Nearby House Prices](https://github.com/mdowds/nearby-house-prices-app) app.

Returns average house prices based on your current location. Data is taken from the [related API](https://github.com/mdowds/nearby-house-prices-api), which in turn gets its data from the [Land Registry](http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/).

A live version of the app can be found at <https://mdowds.com/nearbyhouseprices/>
